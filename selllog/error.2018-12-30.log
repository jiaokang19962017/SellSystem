Description:

Configuration property name 'projectUrl' is not valid:

    Invalid characters: 'U'
    Bean: projectUrlConfig
    Reason: Canonical names should be kebab-case ('-' separated), lowercase alpha-numeric characters and must start with a letter

Action:

Modify 'projectUrl' so that it conforms to the canonical names requirements.
